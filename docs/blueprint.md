## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A warm, earthy terracotta (#E07A5F) to reflect the natural materials and craftsmanship of the artisans. The warmth connects to feelings of history, while being very current in design trends.
- Background color: A light, desaturated beige (#F2E8D5), complementing the terracotta, creating a clean and inviting space for content to stand out.
- Accent color: A muted mustard yellow (#D8C3A3) provides a contrasting highlight for key UI elements, echoing traditional textile dyes.
- Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) offers a balance of modern readability with a touch of humanist warmth, ideal for product descriptions and artisan stories.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif), a transitional serif similar to Didot, lends an elegant and high-end feel that's suited to headlines or small amounts of text. Since longer text is anticipated in other areas of the site, 'PT Sans' is a better match for the body text.
- Use hand-drawn style icons with rounded edges to add a personal, authentic touch that reflects the handmade nature of the crafts.
- Employ a grid-based layout with generous spacing and a focus on visual hierarchy to present products and stories in an organized, appealing manner. Focus on a mobile-first design approach.
